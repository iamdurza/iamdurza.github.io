    <h2>Skin is part of the Integumentary System. 
      It is a major defense against disease-causing organisms called pathogens.
      It's made of 3 parts: the epidermis, dermis, and subcataneus layers. 
      The epidermis is the outer layer of tissue in human skin.
      It's made of dead skin cells.
      Living cells replace the dead cells when they wear off.
      Mitosis gives your skin enough cells to replace the dead ones.
      Dermis is a thick inner layer of skin.
      It's made of connective tissue.
      It contains blood vessels, nerve receptors, and hair follicles.
      It also contains the sweat glands, oil gland, and wax glands.
      Special cells make fibers which are woven around and between all these structures to connect them together.
      The subcutaneous layer is fat cells and fiber underneath the dermis.
      It is insulation and cushion.
      Fibers attach to the muscles here. 
      Blood vessels are found throughout.
      The skin functions are:
      Sensation – nerve response to senses,
      Protection – from friction and chemicals,
      and regulation of body temp. 
      Skin cancer is one disease cause by the sun.
      It covers and protects the muscle system.
