    <h2>Part of Integumentary System 
      Major defense against disease-causing organisms -- Pathogens 
      Made of 2 parts 
      Epidermis – outer layer of tissue in human skin 
      Made of dead skin cells 
      Living cells replace the dead cells when they wear off 
      Mitosis gives your skin enough cells to replace the dead ones 
      Dermis – thick inner layer of skin 
      Made of connective tissue 
      Contains blood vessels, nerve receptors, hair follicles 
      Sweat glands, oil gland, wax glands 
      Special cells make fibers which are woven around and between all these structures to connect them together 
      Used for designing prothesis 
      Subcutaneous layer – fat cells and fiber underneath the dermis 
      Insulation and cushion 
      Fibers attach to the muscles 
      Blood vessels are found throughout  
      Skin Functions 
      Sensation – nerve response to senses  
      Protection – from friction and chemicals 
      Callus – epidermis thickens to protect  
      Blisters – skin exposed to friction or heat to fast 
      Regulation of body temp 
      Blood vessels and sweat glands allow blood to flow to dif places 
      Skin Color 
      Melanin – dark pigment that causes skin color 
      Carotene – yellower pigment  
      Skin cancer is one disease cause by the sun
