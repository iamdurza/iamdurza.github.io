    <h1>Bone Notes</h1>
    <h3>
      Bones are actually living tissue! Isn't that cool? They are made of living cells surrounded by a non-living shell! These layers are called osteon. Bones are both an organ and a tissue! If you break one, it 
      hurts. Inside bones are tiny veins, and bone marrow. There is 2 types of bone marrow; yellow and red. Red bone marrow produces blood cells. As it ages, it becomes yellow bone
      marrow, a fatty tissue. The white outer layer of bone is called perostium. Ligaments are tough flexible bands of connective tissue that hold bones together. Tendons hold the 
      muscle to the bone. The inside of many bones is full of sponge like spaces, called spongy bone, though they are quite rigid. Your skeleton is all the bones in your body. It 
      gives your body shape and protects its organs. It stores minerals like calcium and phosphorus. There are lots of different joints, where 2 or more bones connect. Hinge, bend
      in 1 direction, gliding, slide and twist, ball-and-socket, free rotation, and pivot, circular movement.</h3>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <h3>Over half the body's bones are in the hands and feet. The hyoid bone in your throat is the only jointless bone in your body. Babies are born with 300, and some fuse over
      time; adults have 206. Teeth aren't considered bones, but are part of the skeletal system. The jawbone is the only bone that can move.
